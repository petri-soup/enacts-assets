The Paraceratherium is an herbivore megafauna living on land. It feasts on seaweed and kelp, while the babies eat moss and sea algae. The Paraceratherium lives in herds, and its size allows it to reach the top of the kelps, where the sweetest fruit has absorbed the most sunlight. Babies stay in the same herd as their mothers for life. It’s thought that the Paraveratherium’s heavy steps pack down the land, keeping it from evaporating into the atmosphere.        </h3>          </span>
